# hf-skills

Standalone Hugging Face skills installer CLI.

## Why include a Manifest?

The [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) spec doesn't require a version in the frontmatter. When version numbers are included, they often aren't updated as the skill changes. A small manifest describing the source commit (local or remote) makes auto-updating simple!

## Commands

```bash
Usage: hf-skills [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Browse, install, and manage skills from the Hugging Face skills marketplace.

  --install-completion  Install completion for the current shell.
  --show-completion     Show completion for the current shell, to copy it or customize the installation.
  -h, --help            Show this message and exit.
